### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
<details>
	<summary>Introduction</summary>

	Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

	Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

Thus, in this project we analyze the Bikeshare data from three (3) major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York and Washington.
The solution interacts with the user by asking for user inputs which are then used to load and filter the data.
Then appropriate analysis are done on the data as required.
